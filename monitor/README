The Monitor is the backbone of the robotic nature of the observatory.
It is the main module handling opening and closing of the dome and power on/off the telescope. 
It is constantly checking a large number of conditions and parameters and will take action if some issues occur or other conditions
like sunrise is approaching etc.

The scheduler was originally the main module selecting which observing request (OR) to observe. 
With the implementation of the Conductor this changed and the scheduler will usually have only one OR to select from.
The scheduler will then check if the OR is executable (star is visible, weather is great, telescope ready etc.) and then execute it.

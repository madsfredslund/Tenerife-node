The RS232 interface on the Iodine Heat Controller is not working with telnet do to wrong combination of \n\r I guess. 

Use python and sockets.

Baud rate: 115200
Data Bits: 8
Parity:	   None
Stop Bits: 1
Flow Ctr:  None

When using the Ethernet to RS232/Serial converter the address is:

IP = 10.12.14.96 	#	moxa16b1.phys.au.dk
PORT= 4002
